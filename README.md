Alfred workflow for Moby Games search

## Features

1. **Search Games**  
    Results
    - title
    - platform
    - url (hold cmd to show)
    - open URL (press enter)

## Future

I'd like to add the following
- image thumbnails, so the correct game can more easily be chosen
- display Alternate Titles, so foreign titles can be seen
- release information like year and country

### Note

You'll need to configure the workflow with your own API Key - easily done, instructions are included during installation.
